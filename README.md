FoodMenu is an easy-to-use hostel food ordering web application that allows students and residents to browse the food menu and place orders directly from any device — without the need for waiters or manual order taking.

This project is designed to be generic and reusable for any hostel. You don’t need to change the code to adapt it; just update configuration (menu items, prices) via a JSON object.
